# ReactMeals food order app!

This project is a fake food order application which helped me to learn and understand ReactApp, especially the concept of the cart in the shop and also manipulations of the items' numbers inside. It is also connected with Firebase, so the available meals are fetching from the server.

## What you can do here?

You have presented a few uniqe dishes with their short descriptions and a price. You can add them to the cart, as many and in any configuration as you like. You can also increase or decrease their amount, open and close the cart. After you click the "Order" button, you will see a simple form to fill in, and at the end you can "send" your order :)


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
